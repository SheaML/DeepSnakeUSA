# DeepSnakeUSA
Using computer vision to identify venomous snakes from the U.S.A.

The DeepSnakeUSA.ipynb notebook demonstrates the training of the model. I use transfer learning and the resnet50 model. 

The pretrained model is stored in `models/snake-usa.pth`. 

For single-image prediction, I'm using a Flask web app (app.py).


To Do:

Deployment using docker + AWS lamba / Now
